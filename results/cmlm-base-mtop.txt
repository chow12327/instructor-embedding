INFO:sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer:Load pretrained SentenceTransformer: sentence-transformers/use-cmlm-multilingual
Some weights of the model checkpoint at /home/nchowdhr/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/sentence-transformers_use-cmlm-multilingual/ were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.decoder.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
